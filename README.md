This document accompanies the replication files for the dissertation titled *"Chinese Financial Flows: A Growth Lever for Recipient Economies?"*  

It provides a detailed explanation of the data, scripts used, and results generated, facilitating the understanding and replication of the analyses performed.  

The repository is organized into three main directories that cover the different stages of data processing and analysis.

### Directories  

#### **Data Folder**  
This folder contains all the data necessary for the analysis:  
- **Raw Databases:** Initial data downloaded directly from their respective sources, each in a dedicated sub-folder.  
- **Intermediate and Final Databases:** Data cleaned and processed, ready for subsequent analyses.  

#### **Results Folder**  
This folder contains the outputs of the analyses:  
- **Images:** Graphs and visuals created to illustrate the analysis results.  
- **Tables:** Tables with descriptive data and regression results.  
- **Script Outputs:** Specific output files generated by the executed scripts.  

#### **Script Folder**  
This folder contains all the source codes used for analyses and visualizations:  
- **R, Python, and Stata Software:** Each script file is numbered and documented to reflect the project's progression, from initial data handling to econometric analyses.  
- **Supplementary Procedures:** Scripts marked with "AX," including specific tasks like network graph creation or mapping.

- **5_Manage missing data.Rmd:**  
  Handles missing data using imputations. *(R)*  

- **6_Analyse Économétrique:**  
  Conducts analyses to evaluate the impacts of Chinese financial flows on growth, using econometric models. *(Stata)*  
  - **6_Analyse Économétrique (sans Big 4):** Econometric analyses excluding the Big 4. *(Stata)*
